# sparrow

[![test](https://github.com/balicat/sparrowcli/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/balicat/sparrowcli/actions/workflows/test.yml)

**A terminal client for any Apache Arrow Flight / Flight SQL server.**
One static binary: browse the catalog, run SQL, stream Arrow onward.
Human-friendly on a TTY, machine-friendly in a pipe, **agent-friendly by design**.

Most Flight servers ship SDKs. Sometimes you just want to inspect one from a
terminal. And the pipe is first-class: **a table when you're reading, raw
Arrow IPC when you're piping — the same command does both.**

> **Status** &nbsp; ✔ works against five independent Flight SQL servers &nbsp;·&nbsp; ✔ [binaries for Linux · macOS · Windows](https://github.com/balicat/sparrowcli/releases)
> **Validated against** &nbsp; ✔ GizmoSQL (DuckDB) &nbsp; ✔ Sparrow Flight &nbsp; ✔ ROAPI (DataFusion) &nbsp; ✔ Dremio OSS &nbsp; ✔ InfluxDB 3 Core

## Quick start — four commands

```sh
# a live 136-million-row Flight SQL server, open for exactly this:
sparrow connect grpc+tls://flight.sparrowflight.io:443 --basic demo:demo

sparrow ls
sparrow info series_data
sparrow sql "SELECT series_id, COUNT(*) FROM series_data GROUP BY 1 LIMIT 5"
```

## Commands

| command | does | wire calls |
|---|---|---|
| `sparrow connect <uri>` | verify + save a profile | vendor probe via `GetSqlInfo`, `SELECT 1` fallback |
| `sparrow orient` | one-shot markdown map: vendor, every table, every schema | `GetSqlInfo` + `GetTables` w/ schemas |
| `sparrow ls [pattern]` | list tables | `GetTables` — the one discovery RPC that works everywhere |
| `sparrow info <table>` | schema, catalog, row count | `GetTables` w/ schema; `LIMIT 0` fallback |
| `sparrow sql "<query>"` | run a statement (`-` = stdin, `-f query.sql` = file) | `CommandStatementQuery` → `GetFlightInfo` → `DoGet` |
| `sparrow doctor` | layered connection diagnosis — names the layer that breaks | staged: DNS → TCP → TLS/ALPN → auth → `GetTables` → `SELECT 1` |
| `sparrow check <table>` | data doctor: nulls, duplicate keys, staleness, frozen series, outliers | server-side SQL aggregates — the table is never downloaded |
| `sparrow ping` | latency percentiles: bare TCP vs warm-channel RPC — the gap is the server | repeated no-match `GetTables` on one channel |
| `sparrow profiles` | list saved connections (`use <name>` / `rm <name>`) | — |

Auth — the two adapters that cover the whole tested landscape:

```sh
--basic user:pass                          # GizmoSQL, Dremio, Sparrow (API key as user
                                           # works; Bearer handoff adopted automatically)
--bearer TOKEN --header database=mydb      # InfluxDB 3 style: token + per-call metadata
```

TLS: `grpc://` plain, `grpc+tls://` verified, `--tls-skip-verify` for
self-signed. The CLI identifies the server by trying `GetSqlInfo` first, then
`SELECT version()` as a fallback — Dremio answers the second, InfluxDB the
first; between them, every server identifies itself.

## Output — pick your consumer

```sh
sparrow sql "..."                    # TTY: aligned table · pipe: raw Arrow IPC
sparrow sql "..." -o md              # markdown table
sparrow sql "..." -o csv             # CSV (empty cell = NULL)
sparrow sql "..." -o jsonl           # one JSON object per row
sparrow sql "..." -o json            # JSON array
sparrow sql "..." -o data.parquet    # file sink: .parquet .csv .json .jsonl .arrow .md
```

**In a pipe, the default is a raw Arrow IPC stream** — columnar data stays
columnar all the way:

```sh
sparrow sql "SELECT period, value FROM series_data WHERE series_id='PET.RWTC.D'" \
  | duckdb -c "SELECT COUNT(*), MIN(value), MAX(value) FROM read_arrow('/dev/stdin')"
# → 10217 · -36.98 · 145.31 — forty years of WTI without leaving Arrow
# (one-time setup: duckdb -c "INSTALL arrow FROM community")
```

## Security

```sh
# private CA + mTLS — for Flight deployments that require client certificates
sparrow connect grpc+tls://flight.corp:443 \
  --tls-ca ca.crt --tls-cert client.crt --tls-key client.key

# sealed exports — in-spec Parquet Modular Encryption (AES-GCM)
sparrow sql "SELECT ..." -o data.parquet --encrypt-key env:SPARROW_KEY
```

The encryption key is hex (16/24/32 bytes), `env:VAR`, or `file:path`.
DuckDB, Spark and pyarrow read the file back with the key — and refuse it
without. Verified against an Envoy that requires client certificates: no
cert → refused (exit 2); cert → query runs.

## Doctor — when the connection doesn't work

Every connection failure looks the same from a client: "connection error."
`sparrow doctor` walks the stack — config → DNS → TCP → TLS → auth → Flight
SQL → round trip — and names the layer that breaks, with evidence:

```
$ sparrow doctor -s grpc+tls://fixture:31337 --basic user:pass
 ✓ config    profile "(ad-hoc)" · auth basic · TLS system roots
 ✓ dns       fixture → 192.168.132.91 (18 ms)
 ✓ tcp       connected to 192.168.132.91:31337 (2 ms)
 ✗ tls       tls: failed to verify certificate: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
             wire presented: subject "localhost" · issuer "Norton Web/Mail Shield Untrusted Root"
             hint: if that issuer is not your server's CA, something between you and the
             server is intercepting TLS (antivirus HTTPS scanning, corporate proxy)
 · auth      not reached

3 ok · 0 warn · 1 fail — first failure at tls
```

That capture is real — a self-signed fixture that "wouldn't verify" turned out
to be local antivirus re-signing the connection, and doctor shows the swapped
certificate straight off the wire. On a healthy endpoint it reports the TLS
version, ALPN (gRPC needs `h2`; doctor says so when a proxy won't negotiate
it), certificate issuer and expiry, the auth handshake, the vendor, and a
timed round trip. `-o json` for scripts; exit `2` if any layer fails.

## Measure — is it the network or the server?

`sparrow ping` runs two round trips per round — a bare TCP connect (pure
network) and a lightweight RPC on the warm, authenticated channel (network +
server) — and summarizes the percentiles. The gap between the two is the
server:

```
$ sparrow ping -n 5 -s grpc+tls://flight.sparrowflight.io:443 --basic demo:demo
round  1   tcp    75.9 ms   rpc    86.1 ms
...
            min     p50     p95     max
tcp        61.3    63.4    75.9    75.9  ms
rpc        75.4    81.4    86.1    86.1  ms   (5/5 ok)

≈ network 63.4 ms + server 18.0 ms (medians)
```

`sparrow sql --stats` breaks a query's wall clock into its anatomy — plan,
first byte, stream — plus rows, bytes that actually crossed the wire (counted
at the gRPC layer), throughput, pacing, and the per-column type/encoding
breakdown. Half a million rows over the public internet:

```
$ sparrow sql "SELECT * FROM series_data LIMIT 500000" --stats > /dev/null
── query stats ─────────────────────────
plan (GetFlightInfo)      79 ms
first byte               404 ms
stream (DoGet)          2304 ms
total                   2384 ms
rows       500,000 in 245 batches · rows/batch p50 2,048 (min 288 · max 2,048)
wire       22.5 MB received · decodes to 22.4 MB (1.0×) — stream looks uncompressed
speed      78 Mbit/s over the stream
pacing     gaps p50 4.2 ms · p95 22.7 ms · max 164.7 ms — 82% of the stream is
           waiting (paced upstream: sender or network stalls between batches)
column     type     encoding  nulls  decoded
series_id  utf8     plain     0      13.2 MB (59%)
period     utf8     plain     0      5.2 MB (23%)
value      float64  plain     0      4.0 MB (18%)
```

That's the stream's full anatomy: the server's batch signature (2,048-row
chunks — DuckDB's vector size showing through), whether the wire is actually
compressed (here: no — the decode ratio would expose lz4 instantly), what
every column arrives *as* (type, arrow-level encoding, nulls, share of the
bytes), and whether the stream is paced by the wire or by gaps upstream —
measured excluding the client's own write time, so a slow local sink doesn't
skew the verdict. Run the same pull against two servers and the differences
name themselves.

Stats go to stderr, so they compose with every output format and pipe.
Every benchmark number this project publishes is reproducible with this flag.
`ping -o json` for scripts; both work against any Flight SQL server.

## Check — a doctor for the data itself

`sparrow check <table>` runs a statistical health screen **server-side** —
every check is one conservative SQL aggregate, the table is never downloaded,
and anything a dialect rejects degrades to a skip instead of aborting:

```
$ sparrow check checkme --key k --max-age 7d
 ✓ table     3 columns · key k · time t (auto-detected)
 ✓ rows      60
 ✓ nulls     v 8.3%
 ✗ keys      1 duplicated (k, t) groups
             e.g. DUP
 ⚠ time      t spans 2026-06-01 → 2026-06-30 · newest point 13.7 days old
             hint: older than --max-age 7d — is the feed still running?
 ✓ coverage  5 entities · rows per entity: min 1 · avg 12 · max 30
 ⚠ frozen    1 entities have a constant v across ≥10 observations
             e.g. FLAT
 ✓ numeric   v: min 1 · max 900000 · avg 16432.25

5 ok · 2 warn · 1 fail — checked in 0.0 s (10 queries, server-side)
```

`--key` names the entity key (uniqueness is checked on *(key, time)* when
`--time` is set, and temporal columns are auto-detected). Duplicate keys and
NULLs in key columns are failures and exit `1` — `sparrow check t --key id &&
deploy` works as a data gate in CI. Staleness, frozen series (a constant
value across ≥10 observations — a stuck feed's signature), dead columns and
σ-outliers are warnings. `-o json` for pipelines and agents.

## Install

Download a binary from [the releases page](https://github.com/balicat/sparrowcli/releases)
(Linux, macOS and Windows; amd64 + arm64), unpack it and put `sparrow` on your
PATH. Checksums included. Or install with Go, or build from source:

```sh
go install github.com/balicat/sparrowcli@latest   # installs as `sparrowcli` — rename if you like

go build -o sparrow .        # Go ≥ 1.25; pure Go, no cgo — trivially cross-compiles
GOOS=windows go build -o sparrow.exe .
```

## For AI agents (Claude Code, etc.)

AI agents don't need a Flight client library — they can just call the CLI.
**One command maps a Flight server** — vendor, tables, schemas, as markdown:

```sh
sparrow orient
```

Then query with results the agent reads natively:

```sh
sparrow info series_data                  # row count for one table
sparrow sql "SELECT ... LIMIT 20" -o md   # readable results
echo "SELECT ..." | sparrow sql - -o md   # SQL via stdin — no shell-quoting battles
```

Conventions agents can rely on:

- `-o md` / `-o jsonl` / `-o csv` are stable, parseable stdout formats — no
  ANSI, no decoration; row-count and timing summaries go to **stderr**.
- Exit codes: `0` ok · `1` query error · `2` connection/auth · `3` usage —
  branch on "server down" vs "my SQL was wrong".
- On exit `2`, run `sparrow doctor -o json` — a layer-by-layer diagnosis
  (DNS, TCP, TLS/ALPN, auth) as structured JSON, instead of guessing.
- `sparrow ping -o json` (latency percentiles, network-vs-server split) and
  `sql --stats` (timing/throughput anatomy on stderr) make measurements
  scriptable too.
- `sparrow check <table> --key id -o json` screens a dataset's health without
  downloading it — exit `1` means findings, so it gates pipelines.
- `-o md` **to stdout** caps at 1,000 rows by default so a careless `SELECT *`
  can't flood a context window (the true total reports on stderr; `--max-rows`
  overrides). File sinks and data formats (csv/jsonl/json/arrow/parquet)
  always emit everything.
- Prefer `LIMIT` in SQL — `--max-rows` still downloads the full result.
- Profiles live in `~/.sparrow/config.json`; `sparrow profiles use <name>`
  switches the default, `-s grpc+tls://host:port --basic u:p` works ad-hoc.

## The landscape (as of July 2026)

Other CLIs can reach a Flight SQL server — none preserve Arrow end-to-end:

| | scope | Arrow stays Arrow? |
|---|---|---|
| `flight_sql_client` ([apache/arrow-rs](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/blob/main/arrow-flight/README.md)) | any Flight SQL server | ✗ — "basic" example binary, one-shot RPC commands, text out |
| [`timvw/arrow-flight-sql-client`](https://github.com/timvw/arrow-flight-sql-client) | any Flight SQL server | ✗ — small RPC-mirror CLI, text out |
| [`usql`](https://github.com/xo/usql) | 40+ databases; Flight SQL as one driver | ✗ — excellent universal shell, but results flatten through `database/sql` to rows and text |
| `bendsql` (né "Arrow CLI") | Databend only | — what happens when an Arrow CLI grows up inside one vendor |
| **`sparrow`** | **any Flight SQL server** | **✓ — columnar from Flight server to downstream process: raw IPC pipe, parquet sinks, typed formats** |

The gap sparrow fills isn't "a CLI exists" — it's Arrow-native ergonomics:
catalog discovery over the Flight RPCs, profiles, `orient`, output that follows
the consumer, and conventions agents can script against.

## The Sparrow family

One transport, many clients: [Sparrow](https://sparrowflight.io) (the Flight
server) · [sparrowJS](https://github.com/balicat/sparrowjs) (the browser) ·
[sparrowXL](https://sparrowflight.io/excel) (Excel) ·
[sparrowMCP](https://sparrowflight.io/mcp) (AI agents) · **sparrowCLI** (the
terminal).

---

Dialect note: your SQL passes through untouched — quirks are the server's
business (e.g. Dremio rejects aliases on FROM-less SELECTs; the CLI reports
the server's error verbatim and exits 1).
